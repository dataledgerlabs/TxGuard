# TxGuard

## Executive Summary

The financial landscape has evolved—clients now wield blockchain addresses as identities alongside traditional accounts, engaging in decentralized activities that challenge conventional oversight.

The solution is planned to be build on Amazon Web Services (AWS). **TxGuard** delivers a comprehensive view of financial identities on the **Qubic blockchain,** ensuring compliance with AML and KYT standards.
